# Security Check
Final project for Java Developer Web course in Coders Lab.
The application let's its users check the security and strength of their passwords
and teaches them a valuable lesson about password security. 
Security Check includes a list of nearly 200.000 existing words in English and a list of profanities in Polish.
Passwords are checked to find out if they include upper and lower case, numbers, special characters, existing words in English and profanities in Polish.
User is also informed if his password appears on a list of most used passwords in 2017 (for example "admin" or "123456").
